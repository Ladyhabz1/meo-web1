# 1Ô∏è‚É£ STK Push (The Kickoff)

# Think of this as you (the donor) kicking the ball to Safaricom.

# In real terms, your backend system tells Daraja (M-Pesa API):

# ‚ÄúHey, please ask this donor to approve Ksh 500 payment on their phone.‚Äù

# Immediately, M-Pesa sends a pop-up prompt (the STK push) on the donor‚Äôs phone asking them to enter their M-Pesa PIN.

# üëâ Without this step, the donor would have to manually go to their phone and send money ‚Äî which would be messy. The STK push automates that kickoff.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Callback (The Referee‚Äôs Whistle)

# After the donor enters their PIN, Safaricom needs to let your system know whether the transaction was successful or not.

# That‚Äôs where the callback comes in.

# Safaricom "blows the whistle" and sends the results (success, failure, amount, receipt number) back to the callback URL you gave them.

# üëâ This callback is like the final confirmation that tells you if the ball hit the net (payment successful ‚úÖ) or if it went out (payment failed ‚ùå).

# ‚ö° In Relation

# STK Push: Starts the process ‚Üí asks donor to pay.

# Callback: Ends the process ‚Üí informs your backend of the result.

# So, Sir, the two are like sending an invite (STK push) and then getting the RSVP reply (callback).
